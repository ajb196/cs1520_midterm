			I'm Austin Bagnato a student in university and (sometimes) a freelance web developer. <br><br>

			I love anything to do with computers, and am passionate about learning as much as I can. I'm always looking into new languages and platforms and trying to expand my abilities. Someday I'd like to create my own games, apps, and software but for now I'm content to learn. <br><br>

			Really I'm a huge nerd, I love anime, video games, and books with a passion. I also love thrills; rollercoasters, motorcycles, haunted houses, and I intend on skydiving someday. I'm also passionate about traveling. I love going to new places and visiting different countries, and wish that I had the mental fortitude to really learn another language fluently.
